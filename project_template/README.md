# Generic Data Science Project Template

## Overview
This directory contains a generic template for a data science project. It is designed to provide a standardized structure for the remaining projects, ensuring consistency and a clear workflow.

## Purpose
The purpose of this template is to streamline the process of creating new data science projects. It includes a sample Jupyter Notebook with placeholder code for each of the key stages of a data science project, from data loading and exploration to model building and evaluation.

## How to Use
1.  **Copy the Template**: When starting a new project, copy the contents of this directory to a new project folder.
2.  **Rename the Notebook**: Rename the `generic_project_template.ipynb` notebook to reflect the specific project (e.g., `project_27_your_project_name.ipynb`).
3.  **Fill in the Blanks**: Open the notebook and fill in the placeholder code with the specific data, models, and analysis for the new project.
4.  **Update the README**: Update the project-specific `README.md` with the objectives, dataset details, and technologies used for the new project.

This template is intended to be a flexible guide, and the specific steps and code can be adapted as needed for each project.
