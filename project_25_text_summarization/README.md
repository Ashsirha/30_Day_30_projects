# Project 25: Text Summarization

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a text summarization model that can generate a concise summary of a given article. We will use a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with attention to accomplish this task.

## Dataset
This project uses the **CNN/DailyMail** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for text summarization. It is available through the `tensorflow_datasets` library, which simplifies the data loading and preprocessing steps. The dataset contains news articles and their corresponding highlights (summaries).

- **Source**: `tensorflow_datasets` (cnn_dailymail)
- **Data**: The data will be loaded directly within the notebook.

## Project Plan
1.  **Data Loading and Preparation**:
    -   Load the CNN/DailyMail dataset using `tensorflow_datasets`.
    -   Preprocess the text data by cleaning, tokenizing, and creating a vocabulary for both the articles and the summaries.
2.  **Model Building**:
    -   Build a Seq2Seq model with an encoder-decoder architecture using LSTMs or GRUs.
    -   Incorporate an attention mechanism to allow the model to focus on different parts of the source text when generating the summary.
3.  **Model Training**:
    -   Train the model on the preprocessed article-summary pairs.
    -   The model will learn to map the sequence of words in an article to a sequence of words in its summary.
4.  **Inference and Summary Generation**:
    -   Implement an inference loop to generate summaries for new articles. This will involve feeding the article to the encoder and using the decoder to generate the summary word by word.
5.  **Model Evaluation**:
    -   Evaluate the quality of the generated summaries using metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).
6.  **Conclusion**:
    -   Summarize the model's performance and showcase some examples of generated summaries.
