# Project 19: Time Series Forecasting

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a time series forecasting model to predict the number of airline passengers. We will use the classic "Airline Passengers" dataset to demonstrate time series analysis, decomposition, and forecasting with an ARIMA model.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Airline Passengers** dataset, which is a classic time series dataset available from the `statsmodels` library. It contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

- **Source**: `statsmodels.datasets.sunspots` (similar time series dataset)
- **Data**: The data will be loaded directly within the notebook.

## Project Plan
1.  **Data Loading and Preparation**:
    -   Load the Airline Passengers dataset from `statsmodels`.
    -   Prepare the data for time series analysis by setting the date as the index.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    -   Visualize the time series to identify trends and seasonality.
    -   Decompose the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components.
3.  **Model Building and Training**:
    -   Check for stationarity of the time series using the Dickey-Fuller test.
    -   If necessary, apply differencing to make the series stationary.
    -   Use the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine the parameters (p, d, q) for an ARIMA model.
    -   Train the ARIMA model on the training data.
4.  **Forecasting and Evaluation**:
    -   Generate forecasts for a future time period.
    -   Evaluate the model's performance by comparing the forecasts to the actual values in the test set.
    -   Visualize the forecast alongside the original data.
5.  **Conclusion**:
    -   Summarize the model's performance and the insights gained from the time series analysis.
