# Project 21: Image Captioning

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build an image captioning model that can generate a descriptive sentence for a given image. This project combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to create a model that understands the content of an image and expresses it in natural language.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Flickr8k** dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset for image captioning. It is available through the `tensorflow_datasets` library, which simplifies the data loading and preprocessing steps. The dataset consists of 8,000 images, each paired with five different captions.

- **Source**: `tensorflow_datasets` (Flickr8k)
- **Data**: The data will be loaded directly within the notebook.

## Project Plan
1.  **Data Loading and Preparation**:
    -   Load the Flickr8k dataset using `tensorflow_datasets`.
    -   Preprocess the images by resizing and normalizing them.
    -   Preprocess the captions by tokenizing and creating a vocabulary.
2.  **Feature Extraction**:
    -   Use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as InceptionV3, to extract features from the images. The output of the CNN's intermediate layers will serve as the image representation.
3.  **Model Building**:
    -   Build a caption generation model using a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) network.
    -   The model will take the extracted image features and the partial caption as input to predict the next word in the sequence.
4.  **Model Training**:
    -   Train the model on the preprocessed image and caption data.
    -   The training process will involve feeding the image features and caption sequences to the model and optimizing for the correct prediction of the next word.
5.  **Model Evaluation and Inference**:
    -   Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like BLEU score.
    -   Implement a function to generate captions for new, unseen images. This will involve a greedy search or beam search to generate the most likely sequence of words.
6.  **Conclusion**:
    -   Summarize the model's performance and showcase some examples of generated captions.
