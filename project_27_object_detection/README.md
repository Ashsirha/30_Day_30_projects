# Project 27: Object Detection

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build an object detection model that can identify and locate objects within an image. We will use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset to detect various object classes.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Pascal VOC 2007** dataset, which is a standard benchmark for object detection. It is available through the `tensorflow_datasets` library. The dataset contains images with bounding box annotations for 20 different object classes.

- **Source**: `tensorflow_datasets` (voc/2007)
- **Data**: The data will be loaded directly within the notebook.

## Project Plan
1.  **Data Loading and Preparation**:
    -   Load the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset using `tensorflow_datasets`.
    -   Preprocess the images and bounding box annotations to be suitable for model training.
2.  **Model Building**:
    -   We will use a pre-trained object detection model, such as a Faster R-CNN or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), available from the TensorFlow Hub or a similar source.
    -   The pre-trained model will be fine-tuned on the Pascal VOC dataset to adapt it to the specific object classes in our dataset.
3.  **Model Training**:
    -   Train the model on the preprocessed images and annotations.
    -   The training will involve optimizing the model's parameters to accurately predict the bounding boxes and class labels of objects.
4.  **Model Evaluation**:
    -   Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), which is a standard metric for object detection.
5.  **Inference**:
    -   Implement a function to perform inference on new images, drawing bounding boxes and class labels on the detected objects.
6.  **Conclusion**:
    -   Summarize the model's performance and showcase some examples of object detection on test images.
